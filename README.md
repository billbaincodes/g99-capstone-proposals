# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

* [Requirements (flexible)](https://gist.github.com/matt-winzer/745abaadb509371dfee2a756c8da0c5e)

## Project Description

flô is a running app that plays increasingly intense music the faster you run.

## Problem Statement

Music can improve running performance, especially when the tempo matches your pace. A static playlist can’t properly match your pace and it’s distracting to change songs mid-run.

## How will your project solve this problem?

flô sets up three playlists that you populate with calm, medium and intense music. Each playlist corresponds to a particular moving speed (calm = 0-3mph, medium = 4-6mph, intense = 7+ mph) While running, flô will automatically play songs from the playlist that reflects your current pace.

## 5 user stories (at least):

* I can sign in and am taken to the home/run screen
* I can populate three different playlists with music.
* I can press a button to start/stop a running session.
* During a running session, when I am standing still, I don’t hear music.
* During a running session, when I am moving, I hear music from the correct corresponding playlist.
* During a running session, when I stop moving, music fades to silence.

## What technologies do you plan to use?

This does not need to be an exhaustive list. We want you to identify major technologies you will be using. This list may grow or shrink as your project progresses.

* Vue (Native?)
* Node.js
* Express
* PostgreSQL (maybe mongoDB?)

## ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram

This does not need to be your absolute final ERD. We want you thinking about your data and how it might be related. Your ERD can be adjusted as your project progresses. 
* **You can draw it out & take a picture (quickest option) or use:**
* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
* Any other software you like
